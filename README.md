This project is a result of a pair programming exercise with an AI assistant.
The primary goal was to explore and demonstrate the capabilities of AI-assisted LaTeX document preparation and troubleshooting.
The content of the LaTeX document (`academic_paper_draft.tex`) itself is largely placeholder material generated for this exercise.

The main components are:
- `academic_paper_draft.tex`: The LaTeX source file.
- `compile_latex.py`: A Python script to compile the LaTeX document.
- `academic_paper_draft.pdf`: The compiled PDF output.

Feel free to explore the commit history to see the interaction and development process.
