## Priority Order
1. ~~Migrate to Gymnasium (Critical)~~ ✅
2. ~~Add GPU Support (High)~~ ✅
3. Training Visualization (High)
4. Code Structure Improvements (Medium)
5. Simulation Visualization (Medium)
6. Performance Optimizations (Medium)
7. Documentation (Medium)
8. New Features (Low)
9. Deployment (Low)
10. Monitoring and Analysis (Low)

## Notes
- Each task should be implemented in a separate branch
- All changes should be properly tested
- Documentation should be updated as features are added
- Performance metrics should be collected before and after changes
- Regular backups should be maintained
